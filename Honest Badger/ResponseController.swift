    //randomizes order of array using a GameplayKit function [will I need to add this to any other 
    //this function is called on the ResponsesTableViewController just before presentation)
    
    //if count from countResponeses() is < 3 then it returns an an array with just one string that says something like "Less than three responses received. For respondents' anonymity, responses will not be presented. Please re-submit question." or something that is written MUCH better
